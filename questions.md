UML
1. Some languages like Java only allow single inheritance. Is there an advantage of of only allowing a single inheritance?
2. Can we have the composition relationship in both ways? If so, is it a bad practice? For instance, class A is composed of class B and class A is also composing class B for another method.
3. Does the template class have to be abstract?
4. Open-Closed Principle:
- dependendent on the class or its functionalities.
- should not be able to modify the class itself but should be able to derive from it.

4. Is the message router a substitute for the pipes and filters pattern?
